### Background and motivation

SCMP is a competitive English-language newspaper in Hongkong. In 2015, Alibaba bought SCMP and became its parent company. Then many outsiders are speculatig that if the SCMP is not a newspaper which has the attitude of neutrality and started to report more news pro-Beijing.

Given Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, is a Communist Party member and some sources said Alibaba is a company which has the closet relationship with the mainland government, it seems that SCMP is changing...and is it really changing?! Does the owner of the media relly influences its content?

We interviewed different related people, such as journalists working on SCMP and some professors. They held different views and even the former chief editor of SCMP said he gave no comment but the judgement can depend on the observation after analyzing the content of the SCMP during these years.


### (optional) Executive summary

SCMP is changing in a unobvious way. Journalists in SCMP still reports some sensitive events, but to some extent, it has been increasing some propoganda news reports, especially for some special days like G20， and this may because now the SCMP focus on showing the good image of China to the world.
